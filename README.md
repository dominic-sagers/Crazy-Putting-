# Crazy-Putting-
 This project implements a mini golf putting game and attempts to approximate (without accounting for rolling or flying) the real life phyiscs of golf. This program allows the player to play against several AI-bot agents utilizing different algorithms such as a modified Hill Climbing method, a Newton-Raphson Bot, and a proprietary Manhattan Bot.
